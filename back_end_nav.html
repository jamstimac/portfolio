                These projects were completed after I graduated from Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. They
                represent the knowledge and skills I was able to acquire while in internships and through
                other resources.

                My most recent work was an internship through Revature, a tech contracting company. There I 
                was able to work on Back-end projects while learning more about coding and industry best-practices.
