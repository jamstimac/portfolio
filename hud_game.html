            <p>
                While developing for an early course where we learned how to use Blueprints in Unreal Engine,
                I was able to make multiple different HUDs for one game prototype. The treasure hunting game
                I developed wasn't the most sophisticated in gameplay, but the simplicity of the HUDs as you
                played did not detract from the overall experience. And, in some instances, such as where a
                player might not know the controls for general keybord games, those controls would appear on
                the screen if the player stood still for longer than a set period. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Other controls that were visible during game play indicated the correct key to interact with
                objects within the game. This is something that I forgot to include in the prototype game I
                developed to learn AI that would have made replaying that game more understandable. While
                developing the HUD, I was able to get acquainted with widgets as well as the generally used 
                blueprints within UE.
