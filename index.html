                    Hello! My name is James Stimac, and I originally studied at UNC Chapel Hill where gained a love for languages.
                    This love quickly extended to a love for learning coding languages as well. Coding is both a language
                    that allows us to communicate across the world and a tool that allows for immense creativity. 
                    Feel free to check out my LinkedIn by clicking on my portrait.

            <p>
                Within the different pages of this website are different artifacts created during my time at SNHU. These artifacts
                range from python programs to projects created in Unreal Engine 4 and 5. They are shown here to indicate the
                varied aspects of game programming I was exposed to. These artifacts also follow a common focus on coding. In my 
                final year at SNHU, I was able to focus on Gameplay Engineering as a potential role through my final course. This 
                led me to create experiences within Unreal Engine that focused on aspects of gameplay as well as the integrations of
                other fields within game development that gameplay engineers combine to create a cohesive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my main concerns while developing this portfolio was choosing artifacts that highlighted my own work while still 
                fitting with the themes of program requirements. A few of the course involved working alongside teams, and although I
                contributed to the final product of those courses, using them as part of a culmination of my work within this degree did
                not meet the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">standards of ethics</a> for coding provided by the Association
                for Computing Machinery and taught to us by SNHU. One code that I stand by strongly is the respect required for the production
                of novel ideas and works. While also copyright law exists for coding, this standard applies to works that are listed as public domain
                which do not fall under copyright law. By understanding that these open source or public domain works requried time to
                develop and thus not claiming ownership over these works, we can ensure that that effort is respected. In the future, I plan to 
                follow these code of ethics no matter what field I work in within the gaming industry. Copyright law is clear enough, but generally 
                having respect for fellow coders as well as abiding by ethics that protect the privacy of others seems obvious. However, to be sure
                that I remain ethical, I plan to stay in contact with the coding communities so that they may help to ensure I follow these ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                To showcase my skillset, I have curated four artifacts for this portfolio. The first artifact is a text-based game
                created in python that I am working on porting to a website with standalone graphics and gameplay. Currently it is
                still in its text-based format; however, this will allow me to easily transform the text-based logic into the backbone
                of the final iteration. To view gameplay as well as the base code navigate to the <a href="py_game.html">Standalone</a> tab. 
                While trying to port this game to a web-browser, I both learned how Web Assembly works and that a game without graphics 
                would not display within the ported site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second, third, and fourth artifacts for this portfolio were created in Unreal. The second showcases different forms of
                interactive and <a href="hud_game.html">HUD</a>s for a treasure hunting game prototype built utilizing Blueprints within UE4. 
                The third, built in UE5, showcases a rudimentary <a href="ai_game.html">AI</a> that should travel around the map and explaine how to 
                play the game. Many of my most frustrating moments were working with AI controller code within UE5. Not only did I learn about
                memory leaks and why null is an important thing to check for pointers within C++, but debugging code developed hastily also taught
                me the patience I needed to develop a functioning code base within C++ and UE. The use of debug messages also helped quite a bit. Through 
                debugging messages I was able to get the explanatory text to display as the player traversed the map, but I backtracked because the AI
                would not move across the map as planned. I am still debugging this specific issue, but I am starting to believe it is due to the skeleton
                of the Crow guide itself or some form of clipping issue that is keeping the pawn from being moved by the controller. The fourth artifact 
                generates a <a href="terrain_game.html">terrain</a> using triangles and utilizing the native shaders of the engine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon I will be working on new solo projects to expand this portfolio with. The major take-away I have gained from my time at
                SNHU is that continual progresss, even if it is miniscule, is always worth it. While studying at this university, I was able
                to learn about multiple different coding languages as well as different APIs and best practices for coding languages. I still
                have much to learn when it comes to more complex issues like shaders and AI; however, I have learned that these courses are
                just the first step to my development as a program developer.
