                These projects were completed while I attended Souther New Hampshire University. They
                represent the knowledge and skills I was able to acquire while at school. This is not
                an exhaustive list of itmes that I was able to complete while attending SNHU for a 
                Bachelor's of Science in Game Programming and Development, but it does include projects
                that I am proud of.
